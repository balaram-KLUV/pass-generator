Password Generator: Demonstrating the Need for Strong Passwords
Overview
Welcome to the Password Generator repository! This project is designed to illustrate the significance of using strong and secure passwords. As an ethical hacker, I have created this script to help users understand how weak passwords can be easily compromised and the importance of adopting best practices for password security.

ðŸ”’ What This Code Does
This Python script generates multiple random passwords of a specified length. The purpose is to show how simple and weak passwords can be created and to emphasize the need for stronger, more secure passwords in protecting personal and sensitive information.

ðŸ“œ Key Features
Generate Multiple Passwords: Create a set number of passwords in one go.
Customizable Password Length: Specify the length of the generated passwords.
Comprehensive Character Set: Includes lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters to demonstrate a wide range of possible password compositions.
ðŸ’» How It Works
User Input:

Number of passwords to generate.
Length of each password.
Password Generation:

Randomly selects characters from a comprehensive set of characters including letters, digits, and symbols.
Output:

Displays each generated password for review.
ðŸ’¡ Why Strong Passwords Matter
Weak passwords are a significant security vulnerability. They can be easily guessed or cracked using simple techniques, which can lead to unauthorized access to personal accounts and sensitive data. By generating random passwords, this script highlights how easily weak passwords can be created and stresses the importance of creating strong, unique passwords.
